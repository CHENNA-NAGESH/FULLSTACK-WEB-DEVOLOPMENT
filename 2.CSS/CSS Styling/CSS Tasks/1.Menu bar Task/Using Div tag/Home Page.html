    <p>An About Us page is a section on a website that provides information about a company, organization, or individual. It is an opportunity to tell your brand’s story, share your vision, history, values, and achievements, and introduce team members. This is where you build trust and credibility with customers. <br>6<br>

        In Shopify’s customer trust research, we found shoppers navigate to an About Us page to learn more about the brand and the people behind the products. Your About Page should address those two curiosities shoppers have to help them with decision making. <br><br>
        
        Shoppers are also interested in a company’s mission. They’ll use the About Us page to determine if they share core values with the business and to decide if they want to shop with you or not. </p>
